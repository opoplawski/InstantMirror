BUGS TO FIX TO MAKE IT ACTUALLY WORK
- We MUST find a way so the client can begin downloading the file while the mirror
  downloads the file.  Any other reverse proxy server would allow this.  This might
  be difficult to implement (perhaps impossible with mod_python?) but this would
  eliminate a bunch of potential client incompatibilities due to the current hacky
  keepalive mechanism.
- Even if apache:apache owns DocumentRoot, SELinux denies by default.
  Need sane solution.


TODO
- implement upstream fallback
- mirror-monitord PHASE I
	Check files in local cache against upstream web server.  If 404, delete locally.
- mirror-monitord PHASE II
	Parse repomd.xml and other *.xml to intelligently know when to expire files
	instead of querying the upstream server during every client download.
