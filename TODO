BUGS TO FIX TO MAKE IT ACTUALLY WORK
- wget --server-response http://PATH/TO/LARGE/FILE
  It constantly redirects over and over again rather than waiting.
  FILE.tmp never gets larger than 8192 or 16384 bytes.
- We MUST find a way so the client can begin downloading the file while the mirror
  downloads the file.  Any other reverse proxy server would allow this.  This might
  be difficult to implement (perhaps impossible with mod_python?) but this might be
  the only sane way to fix the previous problem.
- Even if apache:apache owns DocumentRoot, SELinux denies by default.
  Need sane solution.


TODO
- implement upstream fallback
- mirror-monitord PHASE I
	Check files in local cache against upstream web server.  If 404, delete locally.
- mirror-monitord PHASE II
	Parse repomd.xml and other *.xml to intelligently know when to expire files
	instead of querying the upstream server during every client download.
