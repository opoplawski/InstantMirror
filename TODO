BUGS TO FIX TO MAKE IT ACTUALLY WORK
- Even if apache:apache owns DocumentRoot, SELinux denies by default.
  Todd Zullinger suggested:
  semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t "/InstantMirrorPath(/.*)?"
  Investigate this.
  Unfortunately, we have no automatable solution to this.
- If InstantMirror is downloading a large file, concurrent clients
  step on each other with bad results.  Difficult problem to solve
  without the introduction of a tracking daemon and metadata?  
  Need to think about options.
  Need to study how squid or varnish does it.

TODO
- use mktemp -d instead of a hardcoded temp directory
- implement upstream fallback
- mirror-monitord PHASE I
	Check files in local cache against upstream web server.  If 404, delete locally.
- mirror-monitord PHASE II
	Parse repomd.xml and other *.xml to intelligently know when to expire files
	instead of querying the upstream server during every client download.

THINK ABOUT
- "offline mode" - continue to serve from cache if the upstream server is temporarily inaccessible
  Good idea?
  How do you know if you are offline?
  How often do you check?
